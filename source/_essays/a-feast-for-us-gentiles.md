I gorge myself on what other writers have written about *how to write*. This diet causes me to spend an incredible amount of time wringing my hands and writing about my own process. Just this past week I cranked out six pages (that I hope will never see the light of day) trying to answer the questions of why I write and what characterizes good writing.

Beatrice Warde talks about typography using the image of a crystal goblet. Typography is the practice of composing text on a page to aid the reader in understanding the text's meaning. For example, the white space around the margins of a book's pages are meant to help your eye hone in on the text itself. Warde's idea of good typography is typography that is as unobtrusive as possible in order to let the words themselves be as easily read and understood. A crystal goblet is a window to the wine it holds rather than an ornate chalice drawing attention to itself.

My chief responsibility as a writer is to communicate the Gospel as skillfully as I can. I am the Canaanite woman at Jesus' feet—in the white space—with a crystal goblet and platter, trying to catch crumbs from the broken bread and drops from the poured out wine to serve up a feast for us gentiles.
