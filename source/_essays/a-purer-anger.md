Harry Crews, one of my favorite authors, said this about anger:

"Shrinks and psychiatrists and so on say that anger and rage is a bad thing: A debilitating emotion. You ought to purge yourself of it. I find it a—the greatest motivating force I know."

Despite my adoration of his personality and writing, I've always wanted him to be wrong. I've fought hard against his rightness about anger. I've spent a lot of time keeping my anger down, all the while thinking I was soothing it away.

Recently, a friend I trust more than a favorite author told me I ought to let myself feel the anger. I know now what she knew then: That it would change me.

There were some things that were done to me when I was a kid. Suffice it to say that a man went to jail for doing them. And over twenty years later I'm on the bathroom floor heaving to catch my breath with tears and snot running down my face and my eyes all bloodshot. In the midst of the crying I got so angry I broke out in a sweat. Last night was the first time I ever asked God why he let those things happen. It filled me with rage to have read all the stories of deliverance in the Bible—to know that God is capable of such things and that I received no such deliverance. I tried to brace myself like a man to challenge him to answer for not being there. But the best I could say to God from the bathroom floor, my blood pounding fit to crack my forehead and squeeze my brain out, was that I don't know why he didn't stop that man but I wish he did.

Trees use something like eighty-five percent of the water they absorb for cooling. Water is taken in through the roots and flows through the tree, absorbing heat as it goes. When water transpires out of the leaves it takes the heat with it. Thus the tree is relieved of the heat, or cooled.

Too much water and the roots rot, which prevents water from being taken in. Too little water and the leaves burn and fall off, preventing water from being transpired. The tree chooses to let go of the leaves rather than let go of what water it has through those leaves. A tree can flourish when it gets the right amount of water. The full role of water is to be drawn in through the roots and travel out to the leaves, carrying nutrients as it goes. The act of transpiration is a final act of grace as the water leaves the tree and is taken up into the clouds—into heaven.

We are trees and anger is heat. Our water is to meditate on the law of the Lord day and night.

>...his delight is in the law of the Lord, / and on his law he meditates day and night. / He is like a tree / planted by streams of water / that yields its fruit in its season, / and its leaf does not wither.
>—Psalm 1:2-3



Heat is not strictly detrimental to a tree, to be removed and forgotten about. When spring arrives each year the lengthening daylight hours and increasing heat trigger hormone responses in the tree that are responsible for growth. And neither is anger strictly detrimental. It is the fallen form of a good and beautiful emotion we were endowed with by our creator.

>Be angry, and do not sin; / Ponder in your own hearts on your / beds, and be silent.
>—Psalm 4:4

Just as heat in the right proportion catalyzes growth in a tree, so anger is a catalyst. If you are angry, be angry. But also be steeped in the word lest your leaves burn. I don't know how to be angry and not sin. I do know you can make a whip and use it to drive a crowd out of a temple without sinning.

It seems to me that the best way to be angry at God is to look him in the face and tell him how you really feel, devoid of sarcasm and curses. Don't be lukewarm. Call it what it is. He can take it. Sometimes our answer is in what the question reveals about us. God, I don't know why you didn't rescue me from the fowler's snare that night when I was a child, but I know you could have if you wanted to and I really wish you did.

Another thing happened last Thursday night. Somehow gratitude got caught up in the anger coursing through my veins. I thought about my boys and my wife and I felt a hot love for them rising in my chest. I felt a truth I'd never known before breaking up fallow ground in my heart: Reverence for the gift of their presence in my life. Not as characters in my story, but I as a character in theirs. I felt totally safe. Seeds were sown in that once fallow ground that will grow into giant sequoias.

I used to think of gratitude as a serene emotion. But this gratitude had the thrust of anger and rage behind it. Now that I've felt that force I never want to live without it. It's the force that makes movement—love—inevitable. Maybe it's something closer to the way God meant anger to be—a facet of love, a purer anger.

Harry Crews was right and wrong. Anger ought to be purged but it motivates a hell of a lot of growth as it goes.
