When I was a kid, I used revel in going out to get the mail wearing shorts and a t-shirt in the winter time. Our driveway was about a hundred yards long.  I never put on a coat.  Not even shoes.  I would brace myself in the garage just before flinging open the side door.  Oh, to see that view from the side door with those young eyes again!  The frost cast everything in silver.  The overwhelming brightness of the winter sun made it seem like I was looking at the world through a kaleidoscope.  Even now, I can hear the mechanical crunch-clack of the doorknob turning and the squelch of the weather stripping as I swung the door open.  And the split second when the warmth from the house radiated out of me while the cold came in still hangs in eternity.  Winter.  Bright, clear, tree-branch-cracking winter.  And then I would run like the wind.  I was breathless but so full of breath.  Clean, compressed, condensed, life-giving atmosphere drew tears from my eyes.  I like to think that prehistoric, animalistic instinct protected my feet from the concrete more than shoes and socks ever could.

This feeling of crystalline, eye-stinging winter cold is how I've come to understand truth.  Truth utterly humiliates even as it exalts.  Truth is the most ancient history and the newest prophecy.  Truth is the heat from the distant house and truth is the winter morning so cold it seems that even the bright atmosphere is frozen.  Truth is even the young ones throwing themselves at the mercy of the season for a fleeting, gleeful, safe minute.  Our hearts hammer with truth like bare feet on the concrete.

'Truth is, we're all a bit like kids running out to get the mail: exposed to the world and its cold, rough ground.  So, run.  Be fleet.  Go in truth and race to the end of the earth and then some.  Our feet churn concrete, while we yearn toward judgement day.  We’re free.  We’re on the brink of time, limbs akimbo.  We are so beautiful.  He is so beautiful.  Race to the Son.  See the light crashing down from his divine body.  Hear the shriek of pipe organ streaming from his hands.  His face is aflame with jealous, raging, wild love for his children.  We are Yours.  Love us!
