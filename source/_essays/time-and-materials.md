My son is fascinated with garbage trucks and garbage collectors. He's been asking us to bring an old grocery bag with us on our walks around the neighborhood so he can fill it with the litter he finds.  Candy wrappers, old napkins, cigarette butts, crushed cans, and even shoes go in the bag.  If a garbage collector is one who is employed to collect and dispose of garbage, Delton is authenticated as a garbage collector by doing that work. Even if he is self employed.

Jesus, the Son, employed by the Father, is authenticated as the Christ by fulfilling the job description.  From his birth, right on through his death and resurrection, he fit the bill in person and work: Conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the Virgin Mary, crucified, died, buried, descended to the dead, rose on the third day.  Our beloved Apostle's Creed tells us as much. *...there are also many other things that Jesus did. Were every one of them to be written, I suppose that the world itself could not contain the books that would be written.*

When He showed His time and materials contract to the two slow believers on their way to Emmaus, imagine how they quickened to realize He also paid the bill.
