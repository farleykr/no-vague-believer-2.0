Near the end of the minor prophets, the back forty of the Bible, God asks Haggai: *Is the seed yet in the barn?*  Like a star collapsing on itself, the Old Testament shudders with the gravity of the coming of the Christ.

Some four-hundred years later, out in Bethlehem's back forty, among the shepherds watching their flocks by night, the angels held the first midnight mass. His glory shone around them and the angels proclaimed to the shepherds that the seed was in the barn, wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger.

Let us celebrate with the angels the wonder of the tender and mild Jesus come into the world!  Let us celebrate being able to look on the power of Jesus—a power such that even the weakest worldly form He could take was still more powerful than any shepherd's dream of what a savior could be.  Even his death—a failure of life—was so powerful it unmade entropy, overruling the conclusion of time itself.

*Is the seed yet in the barn? Indeed, the vine, the fig tree the pomegranate, and the olive tree have yielded nothing. But from this day on I will bless you.*

The seed is in the barn. And we shepherds, sped onward by angel song, bring our only gifts: Haste to see the Christ and the chance to proclaim that the He is come, even to Christ himself.
