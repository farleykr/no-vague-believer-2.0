title: Asleep in the Hinder Part
verse: "And the same day, when the evening was come, he saith unto them, Let us pass over unto the other side. And when they had sent away the multitude, they took him even as he was in the ship. And there were also with him other little ships. And there arose a great storm of wind, and the waves beat into the ship, so that it was now full. And he was in the hinder part of the ship, asleep on a pillow: and they awake him, and say unto him, Master, carest thou not that we perish?"

There aren't many things I love more than sleep.  Not just at night but daytime naps tooâ€”especially naps.  I've been taking regular naps since high school.  The more frequent they are and the longer they last, the better. Sometimes I can nap for as long as three hours.

I've got not just a weighted blanket but a weighted sleep mask too. I practice a technique the Army teaches soldiers to help them sleep in breaks during battles.  The gist of it is to relax the muscles in your face and picture a peaceful scenario, like swinging in a hammock under shade trees.  I'm reading a book about the nature of sleep and dreams so I can learn how to further optimize my sleep habits.  The book recommends at least eight hours a night and a daytime nap.  I take melatonin, although the book isn't big on it.

And yet, I still have trouble sleeping.  I can't remember the last time I slept the whole way through the night.  Recently, I started waking up too early in the morning with a headache.  From what I can tell, based on my armchair research, this is a symptom of temporomandibular joint disorder, meaning the muscles surrounding the hinge of my jaw are too tight.  The fix involves massaging the muscles on the sides of the jaw and temples. So now, when I get into bed at night I go at my face like a wad of bread dough.

Every so often, fear and exasperation eclipse my drive to hunt down a full nights rest and I plead with God to just let me sleep.  Let me sleep like Jesus was able to sleep in the storm.  When Jesus was asleep in the hinder part of the ship, head on a cushion, did he dream about creating the world? Did he dream of separating the expanse from the waters? Of mountains erupting from the sea to greet the morning sun?  

That evening in the storm, were the waves remembering when he created them? Were they trying to get close enough to touch the hem of his garment? It occurs to me that even though Jesus could sleep on a boat in the midst of a storm, his sleep was still interrupted by the people he loved crying out for help.  Does sleeping like Jesus also mean waking like Jesus?

Sometimes we need a way to apply the Word and activate its truth in our lives. Sometimes we just need a good story about Jesus. Are there any that aren't good?  I still haven't slept through the night since I first started writing the first draft of this essay a few weeks ago. But it's reassuring to know that even Jesus couldn't get a full night's rest.

Are we not like the disciples, unable to sleep through storms and screaming for help? He wakes in the storm so we can fall asleep in the garden.
