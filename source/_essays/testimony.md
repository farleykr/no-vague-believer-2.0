When I was seven years old I asked my mom if she would help me pray to be saved.  She led me through a prayer in the living room of our apartment in downtown Manteo, North Carolina.  I prayed that Jesus would be my savior and take away my sins.

Take John 1:35-39 for a parallel:

*The next day John was there again with two of his disciples. When he saw Jesus passing by, he said, “Look, the Lamb of God!”*

*When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus. Turning around, Jesus saw them following and asked, “What do you want?”*

*They said, “Rabbi” (which means “Teacher”), “where are you staying?”*

*“Come,” he replied, “and you will see.”*

Jesus' first words in John's Gospel: *What do you want?*  Has a more beautiful and more fearsome question ever been asked?

Andrew was already following Jesus when he asked him what he wanted. Of all the things he could have asked, Andrew just wanted to know where Jesus was staying.  You can imagine him flustered and saying the first thing that came to mind.  He followed Jesus like a cub playing at hunting, stalking its prey.  He soon found out he'd caught a tiger by the tail.

We're all already looking for the Lamb of God.  He asked me what I wanted when I was seven.  I asked Him to be my savior and to take away my sins.  I'm not playing at being pure of heart.  I didn't know what else to ask for.  Like Andrew, I stammered out the first thing that made sense when I found myself caught in the tiger's gaze.

I've heard all sorts of explanations for why the disciples chose to abruptly drop what they were doing to follow Jesus when they were called.  The best I've heard simply state the fact unadorned that it was *Jesus* who called them.  I claim this answer for myself as well.  Prey doesn't choose to be prey.

Andrew's brother Peter, the rock on which the church is built, would later write: *With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.*  In this momentary-infinite timeline, the entirety of my earthly life will be captured in the span of time it took Jesus to ask me what I want and for me to even *begin* to follow.  I stay—*in motion*— because I still have questions.
