                        <p>About a month ago I was wracking my brain for something to write about and eventually I turned to my last resort when I can't find an idea to land on: prayer. So I prayed to the Lord and asked him to give me an essay, or at least an idea. This went on for a few days.</p>

<p>For years, I've used the image of an archaeological dig to describe my writing process. I spend countless hours digging and sifting dirt, looking for buried treasures. The dirt goes over my shoulder and I commit the treasures to essays. I spend a lot more time slinging dirt than finding treasures. I always thought it would be crass and lazy to publish the dirt. It would be a disservice to people who care about what I have to say to carelessly toss out some dirt. But here we are.</p>

<p>Delton, my oldest son, has his own dig site: a small patch of dirt next to our tool shed.  He calls it his "place".  And it is full of holes. His three-year-old brow furrows and he sweats and he works harder than the shovel and he even seems to forget about time when he digs.  Once in a while he'll employ me to dig by his side. Just dig.</p>

<p>How often do we dig and dig and dig for answers, all the while not realizing that the digging is the answer?  With every thrust of the shovel into our sandy clay places our bent backs become molded into what we've been seeking.  So dig, believer, dig!</p>
