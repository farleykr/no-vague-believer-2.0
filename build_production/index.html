            <p>On January 6th, my Grandpop—C.L. Reynolds—succumbed to the COVID-19 virus.  This morning, at 10:27, it took my Grandmom—Carrie Lee Reynolds. I'm couched down between the weight of these twin burdens of death.</p>

<p>A friend of mine used to say <em>there's no more fight left in this dog</em>.  When found naked on the side of the road, Jeffrey Chaucer tells Sir Ulrich von Liechtenstein that he's trudging. <em>To trudge: the slow, weary, depressing yet determined walk of a man who has nothing left in life except the impulse to simply soldier on</em>. I find myself alternating between trudging and weeping and sometimes doing both at the same time.</p>

<p>What a colossal jape is death—Satan's impotent fury. He came 'round, mocking justice and consuming iniquity, with his unequal weights and false scales. The burden of death is having to put up with Satan's bullshit.</p>

<p>Jesus often compares us to sheep but I swear sometimes I just feel like an ass between two burdens: bemused at the saddlebags across my back while I watch the young thoroughbreds trucking royalty with their heads held high.</p>

<p>My dad—the ass who sired me—said one time that at his funeral I should tell people "I promise you he's more happy now than he ever was when he was alive."  Sometimes I feel like I can see the good rest and the pleasant land and I'm inclined to give my sons the same instructions about my own funeral.</p>

<p>I guess if I were the ass carrying Jesus—O' what a blessed burden—into Jerusalem for his Triumphal Entry I'd be really hoping he meant it when he said his burden was light.</p>
